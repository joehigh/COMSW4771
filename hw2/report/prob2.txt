\subsection*{Problem 2: Inconsistency of the fairness definition}

\begin{enumerate}[\bf (i)]

\item Only trivial scenarios are able to satisfy all three fairness definitions simultaneously. Consider the problem of hiring (``hire'' vs. ``do not hire'') where the sensitive attribute is gender (``male'' vs. ``female''). In this case, if there are an equal number of male and female candidates, and they are hired at exactly equal rates (and we have a perfect classifier), then all three fairness definitions can be satisfied. The number of men and number of women must be the same, as well as the number of men hired and the number of women hired.

\item Demographic Parity tells us that:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbb{P}_0[\hat{Y}=\hat{y}]=\mathbb{P}_1[\hat{Y}=\hat{y}]
\end{equation}
This implies that the predicted class is independent of the sensitive attribute:
\begin{equation}
	\hat{Y}\perp A
\end{equation}
and by the symmetry property of conditional independence:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:dp}
	A \perp \hat{Y}
\end{equation}
On the other hand, Predictive parity is defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbb{P}_0[Y=y|\hat{Y}=\hat{y}]=\mathbb{P}_1[Y=y|\hat{Y}=\hat{y}]
\end{equation}
Which tells us that the sensitive attribute is independent of the true class, given the predicted class:
\begin{equation}
	A \perp Y|\hat{Y}
\end{equation}
Thus, if $A \not\perp Y$,
\begin{equation}
	A \not\perp \hat{Y}
\end{equation}
which contradicts equation \ref{eqn:dp}, showing that Demographic Parity and Predictive Parity cannot both hold if $A \not\perp Y$.
\item As in part (ii), demographic parity gives that:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:dp2}
	\hat{Y} \perp A
\end{equation}
The Equalized Odds fairness metric says that the predicted class is independent of the sensitive attribute, given the true class:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:eo}
	\hat{Y} \perp A | Y
\end{equation}
For both equations \ref{eqn:dp2} and \ref{eqn:eo} to be true, either the sensitive attribute OR the predicted class must be independent of the actual class:
\begin{equation}
	A\perp Y
\end{equation}
OR
\begin{equation}
	\hat{Y}\perp Y
\end{equation}
Thus, if $A\not\perp Y$ and $\hat{Y}\not\perp Y$, both Demographic Parity \ref{eqn:dp2} and Equalized Odds \ref{eqn:eo} cannot hold at the same time.
\item

\end{enumerate}
